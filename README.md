# ✅ Task Manager App – Fullstack (React + Node.js + MongoDB)

A full-featured Task Manager web app built using **React.js (Frontend)**, **Node.js + Express (Backend)**, and **MongoDB (Database)**.

The application is designed to allow users to register, log in, and manage their personal tasks with a clean and responsive UI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 User registration and login with JWT
- 📌 Secure password hashing with `bcrypt`
- 📋 Create, Read, Update, Delete tasks
- 🔁 User-specific tasks (only you can access yours)
- ⚛️ React frontend with React Router
- 🌐 Axios for API requests
- 🎨 Responsive UI (mobile and desktop)

---
## ✅ Project Status

**✅ Fully functional** — both frontend and backend completed.  
You can register/login, get your token, and perform all CRUD operations on your tasks with real-time database updates.

 Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

> 🔒 Note: `.env` is already included in `.gitignore` and will not be uploaded to GitHub.

## 💻 Getting Started

### Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kunal-41/task-manager-fullstack.git
cd task-manager-fullstack
```

### Run Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Backend 

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
npm start


```
⚠️ Make sure MongoDB is connected (Atlas or local)

Then open:  
📍 `http://localhost:3000` (Frontend)  
📍 `http://localhost:5000` (Backend API)

---

## 📌 Important Note

> 🔧 Some parts of the frontend UI (task list, logout button, etc.) are minimal and can be improved.  
> 🚧 Backend is **functionally complete**, but additional validations and frontend integrations can still be added later.
